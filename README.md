In this project i built a to-do application in React JS with a firebase backend and a CRUD functionality to store all my to-do list.
once a user completes any todo task he/she marks it by event listener action(onClick, onChange) and our firebase backend updates immediately via asynchronous function; thus, changing from false to true(boolean action) in the backend.
setting state functionality when a user tries to create new todo list.
